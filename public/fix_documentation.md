# Jyoti50 Celebration Website Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

This solution addresses two critical issues with the Jyoti50 celebration website:

1. **Time Saving Issue**: Event times (AM/PM) were not being saved properly in the database when added or edited through the admin dashboard.
2. **Event Sorting Issue**: Events were not being sorted chronologically within each day on the front-end website.

## Solution Components

The solution consists of two JavaScript files that work together to fix both issues:

1. **time-fix.js**: Fixes the time saving issue in the admin dashboard
2. **event-sorting-fix.js**: Enhances event sorting on the front-end website

## Technical Details

### Time Saving Fix (time-fix.js)

This script addresses the issue where AM/PM times weren't being saved properly in the admin dashboard. It includes:

1. **Time Input Handling**: Properly formats time values when inputs lose focus
   - Ensures consistent 24-hour format (HH:MM)
   - Handles AM/PM conversion correctly

2. **Form Submission Enhancement**: Ensures time values are properly formatted before being sent to the server
   - Intercepts the form submission
   - Validates and formats startTime and endTime fields
   - Submits the data with correct time formats

3. **Integration with Existing Code**: Works alongside the existing admin dashboard code
   - Uses the existing API methods for data submission
   - Preserves all other form functionality

### Event Sorting Fix (event-sorting-fix.js)

This script enhances the event sorting functionality on the front-end website to ensure events display in chronological order:

1. **Enhanced Time Comparison**: Improves how times are compared for sorting
   - Converts time strings to minutes for accurate comparison
   - Handles various time formats (HH:MM, HH:MM AM/PM, "All Day")

2. **Improved Event Display**: Enhances how events are displayed
   - Sorts events by date first, then by time
   - Groups events by day correctly
   - Formats time display consistently

3. **Added Features**: Enhances the event cards with additional functionality
   - Adds "View Map" and "View Website" buttons when URLs are available
   - Improves time display formatting

## Implementation Instructions

### For the Admin Dashboard (Time Saving Fix)

1. Upload `time-fix.js` to your server (in the same directory as your other JS files)
2. Add this line to your admin-dashboard.html file, just before the closing `</body>` tag:
   ```html
   <script src="time-fix.js"></script>
   ```

### For the Front-End Website (Event Sorting Fix)

1. Upload `event-sorting-fix.js` to your server (in the same directory as your other JS files)
2. Add this line to your index.html file, just before the closing `</body>` tag:
   ```html
   <script src="event-sorting-fix.js"></script>
   ```
