# Jyoti50 Celebration Website - Frontend Integration Fix

## Overview
This fix addresses the issue where header/footer changes made in the admin dashboard weren't appearing on the main website. The problem was that while we successfully fixed the admin dashboard to save settings to localStorage, the main website wasn't checking localStorage for this data.

## What This Fix Does

1. **Header/Footer Integration**:
   - Adds code to check localStorage for header/footer settings when the page loads
   - Applies these settings to the DOM elements on the main website
   - Ensures changes made in the admin dashboard are visible to all users

2. **Gallery Integration** (Bonus):
   - Adds fallback to check localStorage for gallery images when the server API fails
   - Displays locally stored gallery images on the main website

## Implementation Details

The fix adds three new functions to the main.js file:

1. `loadHeaderFooterFromLocalStorage()`: Checks localStorage for settings and applies them
2. `applyHeaderSettings()`: Updates the header DOM elements with localStorage data
3. `applyFooterSettings()`: Updates the footer DOM elements with localStorage data

These functions are called when the page loads, ensuring that any header/footer changes made in the admin dashboard are immediately visible on the main website.

## How to Implement

1. Replace the existing `main.js` file in the `/public/js/` directory with the provided file
2. No server restart is required - the changes will take effect immediately

## Testing

After implementing this fix:
1. Make changes to the header/footer in the admin dashboard
2. Refresh the main website
3. The changes should now be visible on the main page

## Notes

This fix maintains compatibility with the server API - it will still use server data when available, but falls back to localStorage when needed. This ensures a seamless experience for users even when there are server issues.
