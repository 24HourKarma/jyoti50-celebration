## Limitations of the Static Version

This static version has some limitations compared to the full dynamic website:

1. **No Admin Panel**: You cannot update content through an admin interface
2. **No Database**: All content is hardcoded in the HTML
3. **No Google Sheets Integration**: Data cannot be automatically synced from Google Sheets
4. **No User Registration**: Users cannot register or receive notifications

However, these limitations are offset by the reliability of deployment and the fact that all core content is displayed correctly.

## Future Enhancements

Once the static site is successfully deployed, we can consider:

1. Adding a simple contact form using Netlify Forms or Formspree
2. Setting up a custom domain name
3. Gradually reintroducing dynamic features using serverless functions
4. Creating a separate admin tool for content management
