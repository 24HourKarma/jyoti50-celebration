# Wedding Website Fixes Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the fixes implemented for the Jyoti's 50th Birthday Celebration website.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Schedule Formatting Issues

**Problem:** The schedule section in the frontend was poorly formatted and didn't display properly when clicking on the Schedule tab. This was caused by conflicts between `main.js` and `schedule-enhanced.js` both trying to format the schedule.

**Solution:**
- Created a new `schedule-fixed.js` file that properly formats the schedule with:
  - Attractive day headers with appropriate icons for each day
  - Well-structured event cards with visual separation
  - Proper time formatting and location display
  - Icons for different event types
  - Support for dress code, notes, map links, and website links
  - Fully responsive design for all device sizes
- Fixed the tab navigation system to ensure content changes when tabs are clicked
- Ensured proper event listeners for hash changes and tab clicks

### 2. Admin Date Handling Issues

**Problem:** In the admin panel, when editing event dates, they were being incorrectly saved as "April 24-27, 2025" instead of specific dates like "April 24, 2025". This was happening in the `formatDateForDisplay` function in `admin-dashboard.js`.

**Solution:**
- Created an `admin-fixed.js` file that fixes the date handling in the admin panel
- Completely rewrote the date handling code to properly format dates
- Improved the admin form by replacing the generic date picker with a specific dropdown for April 24-27, 2025
- Fixed the `formatDateForDisplay` function to properly convert dates
- Added validation to prevent the generic "April 24-27, 2025" date issue

### 3. Server and MongoDB Connection Issues

**Problem:** The server was experiencing MongoDB connection errors, causing API endpoints to fail and preventing data from being displayed on the frontend.

**Solution:**
- Created a `server-fixed.js` file with improved error handling for MongoDB connections
- Added fallback options to ensure the website works even if the database connection fails
- Improved error logging for better troubleshooting
- Fixed path-to-regexp errors that were causing server crashes
