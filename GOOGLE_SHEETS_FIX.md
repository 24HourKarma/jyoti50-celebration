# Google Sheets Integration Fix

This file contains the necessary fixes to ensure the Google Sheets integration works properly with the wedding website.

## Key Changes

1. **Fixed Module Structure**:
   - Changed from using `app.post()` directly to using Express Router
   - Properly exports the router at the end of the file
   - Ensures proper separation of concerns

2. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - Included authentication middleware within the module
   - Ensures consistent authentication across all endpoints

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for Google Sheets API calls
   - Provides meaningful error messages for troubleshooting

## Implementation Steps

1. Replace the existing `google-sheets-endpoint.js` file with `google-sheets-endpoint-fixed-final.js`
2. Replace the existing `server.js` file with `server-dynamic-fixed.js`
3. Replace the existing `package.json` file with `package-dynamic.json`
4. Ensure the `.env` file contains the following variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT authentication
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` - ID of the Google Sheets document
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` - Google service account email
   - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Google service account private key

1. Log in to the admin dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Sync" tab
